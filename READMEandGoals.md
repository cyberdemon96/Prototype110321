Unity Prototype for 110321

Engine: Unity Web XR (Mozilla) 

Story: The Player is trapped in a world where they are alone in a maze, and must find their way out.
Using Lighting and sounds the Player has to search the maze for the correct way out.
If the player walks through the wrong door the level will reset. (Provided Trigger zones work)

Goal is to get the player to the end of the maze, and explore how sounds and lighting affects the user's perception of the space.
Each section of the maze will have a different soundscape and lighting. 

There will be shameless self promos.
